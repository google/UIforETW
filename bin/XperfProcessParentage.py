"""
  This script uses wpaexporter to export process information from an ETL file
using the techniques described here:

http://randomascii.wordpress.com/2013/11/04/exporting-arbitrary-data-from-xperf-etl-files/

This script relies on having XperfProcessParentage.wpaProfile in the same directory as the script.

Print a process and recursively print all of its children.

Mark the processes as
being printed so that we don't print any processes more than once.
Print with the requested indent level from 0 to ...
Annotate the printout with extra information if the process is
missing from the trace (must have a child that outlived it) or
if the process is part of a loop (some part of the loop must have
reused a process ID).
