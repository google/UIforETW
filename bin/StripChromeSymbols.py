"""
This script exists to work around severe performance problems when WPA or other
Windows Performance Toolkit programs try to load the symbols for the Chrome
web browser. Some combination of the enormous size of the symbols or the
enhanced debug information generated by /Zo causes WPA to take about twenty
minutes to process the symbols for chrome.dll and chrome_child.dll. When
profiling Chrome this delay happens with every new set of symbols, so with
every new version of Chrome.

This script uses xperf actions to dump a list of the symbols referenced in
an ETW trace. If chrome.dll, chrome_child.dll, content.dll, or blink_web.dll are
detected and if decoded symbols are not found in %_NT_SYMCACHE_PATH% (default is
c:\symcache) then RetrieveSymbols.exe is used to download the symbols from the
Chromium symbol server, pdbcopy.exe is used to strip the private symbols, and
then another xperf action is used to load the stripped symbols, thus converting
them to .symcache files that can be efficiently loaded by WPA.

Locally built Chrome symbols are also supported.

More details on the discovery of this slowness and the evolution of the fix
can be found here:
https://randomascii.wordpress.com/2014/11/04/slow-symbol-loading-in-microsofts-profiler-take-two/

Discussion can be found here:
https://randomascii.wordpress.com/2013/03/09/symbols-the-microsoft-way/

Source code for RetrieveSymbols.exe can be found here:
https://github.com/google/UIforETW/tree/master/RetrieveSymbols

If "chromium-browser-symsrv" is not found in _NT_SYMBOL_PATH or RetrieveSymbols.exe
and pdbcopy.exe are not found then this script will exit early.

With the 10.0.14393 version of WPA the symbol translation problems have largely
been eliminated, which seems like it would make this script unnecessary, but the
symbol translation slowdowns have been replaced by a bug in downloading symbols from
Chrome's symbol server.
