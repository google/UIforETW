"""
This script exists to work around severe performane problems when WPA or other
Windows Performance Toolkit programs try to load the symbols for the Chrome
web browser. Some combination of the enormous size of the symbols or the
enhanced debug information generated by /Zo causes WPA to take about twenty
minutes to process the symbols for chrome.dll and chrome_child.dll. When
profiling Chrome this delay happens with every new set of symbols, so with
every new version of Chrome.

This script uses xperf actions to dump a list of the symbols referenced in
an ETW trace. If chrome.dll or chrome_child.dll is detected and if decoded
symbols are not found in %_NT_SYMCACHE_PATH% (default is c:\symcache) then
RetrieveSymbols.exe is used to download the symbols from the Chromium
symbol server, pdbcopy.exe is used to strip the private symbols, and then
another xperf action is used to load the stripped symbols, thus converting
them to .symcache files that can be efficiently loaded by WPA.

More details on the discovery of this slowness and the evolution of the fix
can be found here:
https://randomascii.wordpress.com/2014/11/04/slow-symbol-loading-in-microsofts-profiler-take-two/

Discussion and source code for RetrieveSymbols.exe can be found here:
https://randomascii.wordpress.com/2013/03/09/symbols-the-microsoft-way/

If "chromium-browser-symsrv" is not found in _NT_SYMBOL_PATH or RetrieveSymbols.exe
and pdbcopy.exe are not found then this script will exit early.
