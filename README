The core project is UIforETW which is a graphical user interface for
recording and managing ETW traces. It makes it much easier to control
how traces are recorded than using batch files or Microsoft's wprui.
UIforETW also works around numerous problems with ETW tracing (fixing
symbol loading issues) and adds extra features such as categorizing
chrome processes.

UIforETW also lists all the recorded traces and displays editable notes
associated with each on.

UIforETW is somewhat biased towards Chrome development - it has some
features that are specific to Chrome developers - but it is fully
functional for non-Chrome developers as well.

To use UIforETW you have to install the Windows Performance Toolkit
(version 8.1 is currently the latest version) and then run UIforETW.exe.

This is not an official Google project and is not supported by Google
in any way.
